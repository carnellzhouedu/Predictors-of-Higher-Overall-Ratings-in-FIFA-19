The 26th instalment of the FIFA series, FIFA 19, is a competitive football simulation video game. The game features a large selection of players from real life, each with factual specifications such as their club, age, preferred foot, wage and nationality as well as appointed numerical scores that estimate their ability in a host of categories including dribbling, ball control, composure, and accuracy. Inside the game, the user can assume control of the different in-game players by passing the ball between them. In addition, the user can control an individual playerâ€™s motion, shot-timing (to produce more accurate shots), and dribbling moves to get around defenders.
The dataset that I chose was a representation of FIFA 19's Player Attributes. The data set details 18206 unique players each with the attributes: Age, Nationality, Overall, Potential, Club, Value, Wage, Preferred Foot, International Reputation, Weak Foot, Skill Moves, Work Rate, Position, Jersey Number, Joined, Loaned From, Contract Valid Until, Height, Weight, LS, ST, RS, LW, LF, CF, RF, RW, LAM, CAM, RAM, LM, LCM, CM, RCM, RM, LWB, LDM, CDM, RDM, RWB, LB, LCB, CB, RCB, RB, Crossing, Finishing, Heading, Accuracy, ShortPassing, Volleys, Dribbling, Curve, FKAccuracy, LongPassing, BallControl, Acceleration, SprintSpeed, Agility, Reactions, Balance, ShotPower, Jumping, Stamina, Strength, LongShots, Aggression, Interceptions, Positioning, Vision, Penalties, Composure, Marking, StandingTackle, SlidingTackle, GKDiving, GKHandling, GKKicking, GKPositioning, GKReflexes, and Release Clause. I will be especially focusing on the attributes with high correlations with the overall score.
